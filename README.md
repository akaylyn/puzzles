## 000-AddLinkedLists.c

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and retruns the sum as a linked list.

## 001-AddLinkedListsReverse.c

Same as 000, only the list is reversed.

## 002-StackWithMin.c

How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop, and min should all operate in O(1) time.
